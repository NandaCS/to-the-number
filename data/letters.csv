414,T.S.,,U.S.,English,"I was holding your hands not knowing what to do. 
The hospital was full and they didn’t have space for you.
I was holding your hands
not knowing that this would be the last time. 
“It’s gonna be okay.” 
I remember you attempting to say it 
while catching your breath.
You were strong 
and I know you are in a better place now. 
I was holding your hands 
not knowing how I would deal with it. 
I still don’t know.
Rest in peace.

6848,L.D,,U.S.,English,"Dear P.W., thank you for your time on Earth. Your mission was accomplished, yet, you left abruptly. I wish we had more time to be together, or just to do our projects and dreams. May our God comfort the hearts of your family and your husband. The funeral was empty because we were not permitted to invite so many people. But I know that all of your loved ones would have attended. I was watching a TV Show today and it reminded me of you. Not only that, but many other things remind me of you. I plan to visit your family today. I will take your favorite flowers to them. 
Tulips.
