      <h3>It is a project to build community and heal together. Many of us have experienced loss as a result of the COVID pandemic, and it is often hard to cope with these losses alone. to the number project gathers letters from all around the world in different languages, from people who have been affected in similar ways due to the pandemic and are going through this simultaneously. This is a safe place to pour out oneâ€™s grief and translate it into words. It invites the public to write a letter to a loved one expressing their feelings for them and honoring their lives. Letters are often written in a stage of grief, love, longing, and care. Our hope is that through the act of writing a letter, the writer can find a sense of healing from the inside-out.</h3>
