        <h2>It is a project to build community and heal together. Many of us have experienced loss as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is often hard to cope with these losses alone. to the number project gathers letters from all around the world in different languages, from people who have been affected in similar ways due to the pandemic and are going through this simultaneously. This is a safe place to pour out one’s grief and translate it into words. It invites the public to write a letter to a loved one expressing their feelings for them and honoring their lives. Letters are often written in a stage of grief, love, longing, and care. Our hope is that through the act of writing a letter, the writer can find a sense of healing from the inside-out.</h2>

            <h2>-What is to "the number" about?</h2>
              <p>"to the number" project gathers letters from all around the world, from people who have been affected in similar ways due to the pandemic and are going through this simultaneously. This is a safe place to pour out one's grief and translate it into words. Let's heal together.
              </p>
            <h2>-How does “to the number” work?</h2>
              <p>Write a letter to a loved one and use the link below to submit it to the project. Keep in mind, this person could be someone who passed away or recovered from COVID-19 and/or its variants. Things to know: we don't use your full name. Letters are around max. 400 words. You can submit it in different languages. Accepting now: English, Portuguese, Spanish, Chinese, and Korean.
              </p>
            <h2>-Why are there numbers in each letter title?</h2>
              <p>During the pandemic, we see in the news platforms so much data with numbers of how many people are being infected or passed away due to the virus and at some point it can become normalized. This project gives randomized numbers to each letter to represent one of the individuals that is being counted in the data we see. It reminds us that those numbers are humans, and that each one of them deserves attention.
              </p>
            <h2>-What about your privacy?</h2>
              <p>1. All letters will remain anonymous. We will not collect or share your name with the public. 2. We will not share your email with outsiders. Its purpose is only for contacting you, if needed. 3. You will be prompted to agree with the terms and give consent in the form. Your privacy and comfort are taken into consideration!
              </p>
            <h2>-Where is it taking place?</h2>
              <p>to the number project will start on social media (Instagram) and it will grow slowly. The next step for the project is to be hosted on a website. A future goal will be publishing a book with all letters and exhibiting them in art galleries.
              </p>
            <h2>-Who is in charge of this project?</h2>
              <p>Fernanda Carvalho, a Brazilian interdisciplinary artist based between NYC and Chicago. She has been writing letters to loved ones since Summer 2020 and put a lot of thought and effort into this idea.
